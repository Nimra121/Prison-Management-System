# Prison-Management-System

# Abstract 
Prison Management System (PMS) is an online application which will be made up to keep the records about the prisoners inside a jail. The system will store and update the information about the prisoners and the on-duty personnel i.e. guards. It will be used jailor to enter and update the information about the prisoners and the guards in the jail. However, the jail officer will approve/disapprove some of the actions requested by the jailor. 

# 1.	Introduction and Background
In this modern age, every domain of administration is being automated. The prison record keeping is vey tiresome and costly operation to do by just using paperwork. Moreover, it includes the risk of being altered and the chances of human errors are high for such a critical task. Therefore, we need such a system where the information can be verified anytime. Also, the data needs to be immutable to avoid any kind of anomaly in the system. This system makes sure that the information of each prisoner is being stored and it can be further verified through the national identity databases like NADRA. In this way, the critical task of criminal record can be done in an efficient manner. 
# 2.	Problem Statement
This project aims at solving the record-keeping problems faced by the management authorities of prisons. Also, this system also keeps track of the activities performed by the jail administration over time. 
# 3.	Objective(s)/Target(s)
The objectives of this project include:
    •	A proper management system for a jailor to add, update, and retrieve the information of prisoners coming in and out of the prison.
    •	An interface for the jail officer to see the requests being made by jailor and approve/disapprove.
    •	A database that holds the records of the prisoners that have been brought to the prison.
# 4.	Completeness Criteria
It should allow jailor to:
    •	Add personal details of Prisoner (Name, CNIC, Mobile No, Residence, Crime etc.)
    •	Request the transfer of a Prisoner to other jail(s).
    •	Login to the system.
    •	Add/Delete guards on-duty.
It should allow jail office to:

    •	Delete a jailor from the system.
    •	Receive the requests from jailor.
    •	Approve/Disapprove the request.
# 5.	Challenges
The challenges in this project include:
    •	Immutability of the data
    •	Integration of front-end and backend
    •	Restricted access of each user
# 6.	Knowledge Areas Required
The areas to be required in this project are:
    •	Software Analysis
    •	Software Design
    •	Web Development
    •	Database Systems
# 7.	Learning Outcomes
After completing this project, we will have learnt to use the JavaScript Frameworks that are NodeJS and ReactJS. Also, we will use MySQL as the database in our project. We might also gain knowledge and experience about Web APIs. 
# 8.	Nature of End Product
The end product of this project will be a functional Web Application having all above-mentioned functionalities.
